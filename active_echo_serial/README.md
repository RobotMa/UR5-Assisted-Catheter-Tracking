# Overview
This ROS package deals with reading active echo signals from the active echo controller into ROS system. 

# Future Work
The signal picked from the active echo controller is incomplete, and this can be due to the different version of code that is uploaded onto the controller. Some parameters are yet to be replaced with the corret (default) values so as to segment the point correctly.
