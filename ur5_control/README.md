# Overview
This ROS package contains the main functionality for controlling the UR5 robot arm. Test of inverse kinematics is perfromed first and then motion execution is triggered through ROS actionlib package. 

# Requirements

# Progress
The node file trajectory.cpp is able to syn all 6 joints of the physcial UR5 robot arm. 


# Future Work
Implement the inverse kinematics of UR5. 
Define the state machine for the ultrasound tracking/guiding task by including the ROS smach package.
